French talks about energy, form, mechanism, and economy in natural and man-made things.  He compares birds to planes in terms of fuel-capacity, energy  conversion efficiency, drag, etc.  He compares suspension   bridges and dinosaurs.  He provides examples of neat   inventions and the thought that has gone into them (every-  thing from steam-catapults to toy cars to grommets).  This  is &quot;How Things Work&quot; for the non-moron crowd.	1995-06-24
