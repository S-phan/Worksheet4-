Since \\"discovering\\" the books on a trip to England about 12 years ago, I've been hooked. The Colour of Magic (English Spelling) is a refreshing, ironic twist on the common fantasy novel - and funny to boot. <br />On re-reading, I had to drop it to 4 stars, only because Terry Pratchett's newer works have raised the bar for writing in general.<br />One of the most famous fantasy series around, they are still fresh with 25+ books so far written. Enjoyable, enigmatic, you even have to think occasionally.<br />Cheers,<br />BilFish	2003-03-23

As someone who once subscribed to the Myth Adventures Fan Club, I'm a big fan of Skeeve, Aahz (Oz? No relation) and their adventures! Thus, I find it greatly disappointing to wait so many years for more Myth adventures, only to pay a premium for Myth-Ion Improbable and find out it's nothing more than a poor relic of past glory.    The book was a true shadow tale, with many of the elements we grew to love and respect from Asprin, bluntly visible and obviously contrived.    Unfortunately, the plot itself was non-existent, even the simple type necessary to move along a quest-fantasy style humor novel.    I was able to get past the grammatical problems and misspellings inherent in the editing of a Robert Asprin book, but I couldn't overlook the logical errors throughout.     I will illustrate with one primary element of the story: A Treasure map to find a Golden Cow. Skeeve is immediately bashed on by Aahz (in traditional Aahz-Skeeve banter, we are supposed to believe) for not knowing what a cow is, \\"Skeeve, where do you think steak comes from?\\"    Later in the book, Skeeve laughs at a joke about \\"Count Bovine\\" -- as a reference to cows. Well, since he didn't know what a cow was, I'm quite surprised he can catch the more complex connection between bovine and cow.    Anyway, this is just one of innumerable character knowledge discrepancies that fill this book and kill the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" that allows one to enjoy a humor-fantasy tale.    Asprin's footnote says he needed to start with a simpler book before going on to a more complex and involved Aahz-Skeeve book. Good for him. Too bad he bothered to print it.

The book ends \\"THE END(?)\\" and I must hope that it is. The books have apparently run their course.<br />Harry Harrison is a good writer -- too bad he and his editors fumbled this one so badly. From inaccurate cover art to poor copy editing and inconsistent writing, SSR Joins the Circus is not what I had hoped for when I found out Harry Harrison had returned to the Stainless Steel world of Jim DiGriz. Normally I read an SSR book in a sitting -- this one remains unfinished by a few pages after 4 weeks.<br />Unfortunately, all the old concepts are there, such as DiGriz yelling about his wife's beauty and kids' intelligence, all the while holding down a drink or three. It just doesn't gel in this edition, as if someone read an essay on what makes the SSR books special and tried to write their own version. It's sad to a long-time Harrison fan to read, and I am having trouble finishing this installment.<br />DiGriz is also massively inconsistent with earlier incarnations of himself. Those who read SSR is Born know the first major teachings he had from the Bishop regarded international banking systems. Yet, in this volume, he professes to neither know nor care a thing about banks -- ludicrous, really. He's also quite a bit stupider in this book, along with being much more the pawn and helpless plot twist. Disappointing.<br />Slippery Jim also becomes an even greater lush (wow, how cool...) and can't differentiate between the twins - but neither can Harry Harrison, who gets them confused and switches them mid-sentence towards the end of the book.<br />Read just the first 3 pages to understand the rusty state of affairs for this once-Stainless Steel series of fun space-fiction books.<br />I gave it 1 star for nostalgia.	2000-12-14

In fact, I didn't realize this book did until people on the plane started asking me what had me crying in the aisle!<br />So, if you've been to Europe and haven't read TRAVELS, your trip isn't complete! <br />If you haven't been to Europe, don't read this on pain of becoming most unbecomingly jealous of those who have!<br />Live Europe through the perspicacious and witty eyes of fellow traveler Bill Bryson, the very personable Master of the Travelogue renaissance.<br />A joy to read, it's as much a series of shorts on various locations throughout Europe as a complete novel, connnected by the trials and tribulations of one B. Bryson and companion. <br />TRAVELS also provides a great view back 20 years in European travel - back when Europe seemed a bit more like a 3rd world country, if all is to be believed. Don't let this scare you, things have changed quite a lot (if not the toilets, of course).<br />Cheers,<br />BilFish	2000-06-03

Not just for Anglophiles!<br />If I'd had textbooks like this in school, I might have passed! I chugged through this in a couple of days when I should have been doing something practical.<br />Read it for the laughs, get a bit of education stuck between your teeth.<br />Only Bill Bryson can make the sour study of language so sweet. This book is for more than just Anglophiles and Bryson enthusiasts, it's for anyone who enjoys a good laugh and a comical, yet highly-researched and authoritative look through history's drawers.<br />A cheery romp through our past gives you a great sense for how we got here and why English is so screwed up! An amalgamation of tongues with a basis in German (yet having the fewest words in common with Deutschland -- Kindergarten comes to mind) we find the path to modern English somewhat tortuous, amazingly confused, and always funny.<br />A former copy editor, I was once a great stickler for \\"doin' English right.\\" I've changed my philosophy, understanding that the incredible power of English lies in its mutability over time, changing, growing, enhancing, and staying modern.<br />Cheers,<br />BilFish	2000-06-03
